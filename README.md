# tension_calibration
Code to calibrate cosmological tensions. See (links) for emulators.

To complete the calibration you will need to provide chains (on the order of 1-5k). I have used the following emulators to create these chains:
- Cosmopower for CMB emulation. I have a version that uses Emcee instead of the GPU affine sampler.
- LSST emulator made by Supranta.
